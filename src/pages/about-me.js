                Great to meet you! <br/> As a full stack developer with over 3 years of experience, 
                I started my journey designing web pages with Dreamweaver and eventually progressed 
                to building both frontend and backend apps using a variety of tools.<br/> 
                Throughout this period, I had the opportunity to work with several startups, 
                contributing to the development of complex applications such as DUMO LMS, LandPay, 
                Flitaa, Xtellar app, UseMarshal, Tidier, and many others.<br/><br/>
                During my leisure time, I enjoy exploring the latest tools and software development technologies, 
                including DevOps tools such as Docker and the latest JavaScript/Python trends. 
                My proficiency in JavaScript stands out, as it has been the primary programming language 
                I have professionally worked with. <br/>
                Additionally, I am also skilled in PHP and Python.
